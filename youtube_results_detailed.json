          "full_text": "hey it's Jason I've been using the iPhone 15 for about 10 months now basically since it was released last year and as familiar and as basic as this device may be I'm convinced that this is one of the best iPhones Apple has ever made now I can already feel the eye rolls as that statement has Apple Fanboy written all over it but as someone who's used every iPhone since the iPhone 3GS there are subtle elements about the iPhone 15 that in my opinion truly makes it great and let's start off by talking about design which I know it doesn't look like it's changed in many many years but this is a good illustration of how Apple often focuses on a collection of Minor Details that may go overlooked but usually come together to make for a better user experience if you all remember Apple's last design overhaul was with the iPhone 12 back in 2020 where they introduced this now popularized industrial aesthetic which to be honest doesn't look like it's changed much at all four years later but Apple has made minor updates to the form factor and to me the iPhone 15 is the most refined iteration of this design vision and what you're going to notice SL not notice this the most is with the display believe it or not it does have a slightly smaller bezel than previous iterations and it makes consuming content off the 15 that much more immersive now we're talking microns here so I get it nothing revolutionary but over the past 10 months I have noticed the difference mainly because I use an iPhone 13 for work and I go back and forth between both phones and as subtle as it may be I do enjoy using the 15 a lot more this may also be helped by the fact that this is the first non-pro iPhone to be equipped with Dynamic Island which means that it's also the first non-pro iPhone to finally get rid of the notch that Apple held on to for way too long and though it's still not as ideal as a simple whole punch cutter I do think that this does help make the display feel more immersive than before now the other minor change when talking design is with the iPhone 15's frame it's ever so slightly rounded off as opposed to being completely squared off at the body like other models and this allows the 15 seemed to be noticeably more comfortable to hold while still maintaining the popular look we've all grown accustomed to I also noticed that the frame likely because of its slight curve is a bit more substantial on the 15 you could take a look at how it compares to the iPhone 13 that I have here and again we're talking microns but it does make the phone feel more premium in the hand there seems to be more of a textured matte finish on the 15 as well that provides more grip and is less fingerprint prone and it Blends in beautifully with the color matched frosted back panel this is personally my design update that the 15 brings to the table I totally recognize that it's cosmetic and it doesn't really add to the functionality of the phone but this frosted back is so much better than the glossy fingerprint prone glass it used before and it makes the Iphone 15 the most Pro looking iPhone in the non-pro iPhone lineup and considering how great the design of the iPhone is it's definitely in your best interest to keep it as clean and protected as possible and that's where our Channel sponsor ESR totally has her back ESR is an industry leading brand when it comes to iPhone accessories and they could help keep your iPhone looking Brands making nud no matter how long you use it first for the screen they have their armorite screen protector this piece of tempered glass has military grade protection and is no joke the easiest thing to install just clean up the screen using the included cleaning material then line up this perfectly sized housing over your phone screen just pull this tab at the bottom and slide your finger across the middle cutout and then lift up the housing and voila you're totally done no bubbles or any misalignments truly the easiest thing to install ever and when it comes to protecting the phone itself ESR lineup of Halo lock cases are some of the best for protection and functionality starting with the classic series hybrid case with ESR stash stand probably one of the most clever kickstand Integrations that you can get on a case it's made out of a super tough aluminum and it allows you to use it in both portrait and landscape mode and multiple different angles the unique design also allows you to use something like a Max safe charger while the kickstand is engaged which is lowkey really convenient and dude the Halo lock magnet on this thing is crazy strong which is great if you use a lot of Max safe accessories there's also the cloud series soft case that's made out of a smooth silicone that gives you a solid grip in addition to the integrated stash stand and ultr strong Halo loock magnet but if you're looking for Max protection you have to check out ESR armor tough case it gives you four times military grade protection for every nook and cranny for your phone as it comes with an armorite camera lens protector shock absorbing air guard Corners this tough acrylic back a dual layer edge and a built-in arm right screen protector and a dust shield when fully installed your iPhone could survive drops at up to 13 ft which is kind of insane it's perfect if you're in a line of work like construction where you need that extra layer of protection no doubt these are some of the best cases that you can get for your phone right now and esrs Prime Day discount event is from July 16th to the 17th these products have the biggest discounts of the Year ranging from 10% to 40% off so make sure to check them out today using the link in the description below so let's talk about how the iPhone 15 has done from a performance standpoint now 10 months later this phone is rocking Apple's Powerhouse a16 bionic chip and it's not the fastest as it doesn't have the pro next to its name but it's still a beast in its own right as to be expected the iPhone 15 has given me no lag or performance Jitters when it comes to navigating apps or the operating system I even have a developer license for iOS and I've got a beta version of iOS 18 on this phone right now and it's been able to handle all the new features there's like a walk in the park which is really encouraging now I mentioned Dynamic Island earlier I personally think that this is a major reason why the 15 is quite a jump from its predecessors you can hate on it all you want but Dynamic island is a major part of iOS and it does make the user experience a lot more refined now on the other side of that coin let's just address the 500lb elephant in the room here yes the iPhone 15 does have a 60hz refresh rate which I recognize is wildly outdated at this point and it's something that a lot of people just can't get over now definitely not defending Apple here but what I will say as someone who's actually been using the phone for around 10 months now the low refresh rate from a user experience standpoint really isn't a big deal and that's mainly because of the optimization of iOS with Apple's Hardware being as seamless as it is so navigating around the operating system is smooth and jitter-free even in Spec intensive apps because of this you pretty quickly ignore the fact that it's not as silky smooth as a 120 HZ display because it can still accomplish everything you need your phone to do in a satisfactory manner now is Apple's promotion better in every single way yes without question but that shouldn't translate to suggest that the 60 HZ panel on the non-pro iPhones are overly bad but over the past 10 months the area of performance on the iPhone 15 that has stood not the most in a good way is the iPhone's camera quality despite looking very similar on the outside this is probably the biggest upgrade to come to this phone Apple equipped the iPhone 15 with its larger 48 megapix Main sensor a substantial jump from the 12 megap pixel sensor that was on the iPhone 14 and when paired with the processing strength of the a16 bionic and Apple's Advanced computational photography capabilities you get arguably the best looking photos coming out of any phone right now period plus with the larger sensor the main camera can now give users a lossless two-time Zoom which really makes it feel like it's a program suite and the photos coming out look fantastic plus there's really no debate here the iPhone is the king of smartphone video they've been for a while and really there's no second place and it's no exception here the iPhone 15 can take some pretty incredible 4K video and over the past 10 months I've been blown away at how good the Cinematic mode has become it's a lot cleaner than its first implementation when it comes to subject separation and the bump up to 4K resolution really mixes probably one of the best vlogging cameras that you can get in the game right now and yes the regular 15 can't shoot an apple Pro res raw like the iPhone 15 Pro but I'm telling you now that's a useless feature for like 99% of people and nothing to feel full over especially when the regular 4K footage looks this freaking good and to me the most important thing about the iPhone 15 considering just how feature packed and well put together the phone is is its price I feel as though this version of the regular iPhone is the closest to its Pro brother and the $200 price difference to me makes the non-pro Iphone 15 a much better value this phone is packing so much more than what it looks like on the outside and it's a phone that will be enjoyable reliable and more than capable for the years to come but hey that's just me and I want to know what you guys think what do you guys think about the iPhone 15 do you think it's one of the best apple has ever made or do you think it's nothing special curious to get your thoughts let me know what you guys are thinking in the comments down below and in case you guys miss my review of the new pixel 8A check it out here it's going to help you be as informed as possible",

          "full_text": "I've been using the iPhone 15 for over 8 months now and I've seen a lot of people online talking about how this phone is exactly the same as the iPhone 14 13 and even the iPhone 12 but I would argue that this is the best nonpr iPhone that ever came out and it actually tops a lot of the pro iPhones as well here's why so first of all even though the design looks similar to previous models they actually curve the edges just enough to make it way way more comfortable in the hand and if you pair that with his matte finish on the back it just look looks and feels way more comfortable and premium one more thing that this phone got from the previous 14 pro lineup is of course the dynamic Island and I didn't really care about this feature when it came out I actually thought it's just a differently shaped Notch but notice how I did call it a feature and that's CU it is you get a lot of useful glanceable notifications on it as well as various different controls for different apps all mushed into this Dynamic Island and even though I never really had an issue with the notch uh now after using the 14 pro and the 15 I don't actually think I will be able to go back to an iPhone with a notch because this looks much better it's way more useful and it's simply not wasted space and of course I think we can also call this part of the iPhone 15 design get USBC and again I didn't really think that would be something I prefer over the lightning connector but using uh a USBC iPhone for an extended period of time I actually do do see the benefit of having just one charger to rule them all it's just one less thing to think about now on the iPhone 15 uh it is kept at USB 2.0 speed so for data transfer it's not going to be any faster than lightning was but if you get an iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max you do get faster speeds with that one so if you are using USB to transfer huge amounts of data from into your phone then just note that this is not a fast Port but since I am usually using airdrop for most things I don't really care that much and of course the speed of that Port doesn't affect charging speeds in any way cuz charging doesn't require a fast Port but these are still not great we are talking about iPhones though and all of them charge kind of slow and that's the case with the iPhone 15 it charges a bit over 20 watts wired I'm usually using a wireless charger so doesn't really matter while we're at it if you do need a cool 3 in1 wireless charger definitely check out macback this is the one that I'm using right behind me here this video is not sponsored but I will leave an affiliate Link in the description for their 3 in-one charger which I absolutely love along with the macback case that actually has a lot of additional magnets in it uh aside from the standard Mac safe ring and it fits perfectly with the charger as you can see like I said this video is not sponsored by macback but I do love their products and you can get a discount if you use my link in the description below so charging in and of itself is fine I guess but uh the more important thing is battery life and I actually think that it's pretty good I really don't want to get into screen on time cuz that can vary a lot depending on how you use your phone dayto day but it's solid and it can get me through the day with absolutely no problems since I started using this phone I only had like three or four days where I had to top it up a little bit in the evening but I'm usually ending the day at around 30% but if you really want to talk numbers I would say I get around 9 hours of screen on time on average which is absolutely Fair like if you get an 24 Ultra or an iPhone 15 Pro Max or even a 15 plus you would definitely get more battery out of those models but since this is sort of a compact phone I guess for 2024 standards at least I think 9 hours is more than good enough and it's most likely going to get you through the day with absolutely no issues and that is in part because well it only has a 60 HZ display I'm liking these Segways today I'm doing good it's a 6.1 in super RNA xdr OLED display and it's absolutely amazing in every way like top-of-the-line industry standard stuff but it's not promotion so it's kept at 60 HZ and at first I really had a problem with it but now I just don't care and I don't even notice it anymore cuz I've been using this phone for such a long time that it's just became a normal thing you got to remember that up until a few years ago or like five or six years ago most phones were 60 HZ but on the other hand it's not the strongest argument out there the industry is advancing the cameras are advancing everything in these phones is getting better and better each year and most if not all mid-range Android phones actually get a 120 HZ refresh rate so when it came out and today as well it was one of the only 60 HZ phones in its price range actually I think it was the only one but I really don't feel like it's a big deal honestly and I don't feel like it's something that should be talked about that much I don't mind it I use this phone every day and it's absolutely fine iOS is super smooth anyway and it doesn't ruin the experience for me if it does for you that's also fair and if you want an iPhone you have to get a pro one but putting the refresh rate aside like I said this display is absolutely amazing it has great colors great contrast 1,000 standard Nets of brightness and peing at 2,000 knits outdoor in the sunlight so it's a really bright display I can't really find a single additional flaw to it aside from the refresh rate so if you are looking to get this phone just is promotion something that personally care about or not that's all it comes down to but we've been talking about the display for way too long How fast is this phone you ask it's super fast actually it has the a16 bionic chip and it's not the newest one it's actually the same chip that was in the 14 pro but the 14 pro is also still super fast and there's really not much to say about it anything you want to do you can do on the iPhone 15 and I definitely feel like it's going to stay fast and responsive for a really long time since Apple's chips are generally really good it of course came with iOS 7 and of course it's going to get ios 18 that just got announced a few days ago which is a story for a different video but seems like it's going to be really really good a lot of AI stuff a lot of customization stuff they actually like took from Android and it's going to be supported for a really long time since Apple generally offers a lot of years of software support it has 6 GB of RAM 128 256 or 512 GB of storage I actually have the base 128 model and I'm super cool with it but I'm using a lot of cloud storage so if you are storing stuff on your device maybe go with the 256 version Al it's not necessary it comes in five colors that's black blue green yellow and pink so it has a lot of options all you have to do is pick speaking of picks it has two cameras on the back it actually has a updated 48 megapixel main wide lens and a 12 map Ultra wide so we still didn't get the telephoto on the regular model but since the main sensor is 48 megapixels you can actually use a 2X digital Zoom that doesn't lose out on quality cuz they're just cropping in on that 48 megapix sensor and giving you a 12 megapixel result so you kind of have two and a half cameras on the back I guess the main lens is absolutely great I've been actually using this phone to shoot a lot of my videos recently not this one though cuz it's in my hand now but you know in general colors are nice and accurate it's more than sharp enough and you get most iPhone camera features with it like night mode action mode cinematic mode you get photographic Styles which don't actually use them use the standard one please but you get them if you want them one thing that it doesn't support that the 15 Pro does support of course are those Pro formats so that's Pro raw and PR res and lock for video are these formats something you'll actually need dayto day I don't really think so if you are like a digital Creator or a photographer videographer that kind of knows a bit more about this stuff uh then it might be something that you're interested in you still won't be able to use these cameras like in a professional setting of course but for a lot of stuff it will be a good addition but uh just keep in mind that if you are using these formats they flatten the colors and everything out so you would have to uh fix all these things in post you would have to edit the photos and the videos to get the uh desired result with it so if you are just someone that wants to use their camera like a normal person then yeah you shouldn't use this formats anyway and as just a simple point and shoot camera without too much tinkering this is one of the best options out there and I know you all had sleepless nights thinking about what are the best iPhone 15 camera settings that I can possibly use to get the best result with photos and videos well I actually made a video about it and you can check it out here",

          "full_text": "[Music] hey what's up guys will here for GSM Marina if you're looking for a compact Flagship here are a couple of great options on the one hand there's the Galaxy s24 the compact model from Samsung's S Series lineup and then there's Apple's iPhone 15 which comes at about the same size and price with the obvious differences in software aside which of these is the better Flagship let's put them head-to-head and find [Music] out both the Galaxy s24 and the iPhone 15 are compact yet powerful smartphones that come at a lower price than the top tier flagships out there the design of both phones is quite clean and they're basically identical when it comes to size and weight of course the cameras look different plus the s24 back is made from Gorilla Glass victus 2 while the iPhone uses ceramic shield glass you get an aluminum frame on either phone there's ip68 rting rist protection on both phones too but the iPhones have better protection against water they can be submerged to up to 6 M instead of the usual 1.5 at 6.2 in the galaxy s24 has the slightly larger OLED display and it has a dynamic 120 HZ refresh rate the iPhone 15's 6.1in display has a higher resolution amounting to 461 PPI versus 416 on the Samsung but the refresh rate is just 60 HZ this means swiping and scrolling appear much smoother to the eye on the Galaxy than on the iPhone both panels have excellent brightness and while they both support HDR 10 plus the iPhone screen also has support for Dolby Vision however its large cutout is more intrusive than the one on the Samsung the cutouts purpose on the iPhone is to house both the selfie Cam and the T left camera this enables a secure Face Unlock which is used for all Biometrics that's opposed to the regular selfie cam based face unlock on the Galaxy which isn't as secure for those secure Biometrics on the s24 you'll be using an under display fingerprint reader back to the iPhone's cutout though some might find it in isore at least Apple has found a way to creatively use this space with this Dynamic Island function which extends the bar to show relevant info and display shortcuts both the Galaxy s24 and the the iPhone 15 have stereo speaker setups the system on the Galaxy s24 is a bit louder but the iPhones have richer sound with deeper Bas and better vocals of course both phones use very different software platforms the s24 runs on Android with Samsung's latest 1 UI on top meanwhile you get the latest version of Apple's IOS on the iPhone 15 naturally it brings a different layout and feature set something unique to the Galaxy S Series though are a suite of advanced AI based features developed in collaboration with Google they include Circle to search real-time translation of chats or calls and advanced photo editing Samsung promises 7 years of software support to the s24 it looks better than Apple's practice of offering 5 or 6 years to its phones however we're not sure how well the hardware will keep up with that software 7 years down the line it is a powerful platform in today's terms though the Galaxy s24 can come with one of two chipsets depending on the market either an exos 2400 or Snapdragon H gen3 the iPhone 15 runs on Apple's a16 bionic is powerful but came out in 2022 the latest chipset is restricted to the iPhone Pro Models the Galaxy s24 comes out on top when it comes to Raw CPU and GPU power still the iPhone 15 is no slouch and it does a good job when multitasking and gaming also the iPhone does a better job when it comes to Thermal Management in our prolonged stress test it was able to maintain higher performance than the Galaxy with less throttling the galaxy s24 has a 4,000 mAh battery while the iPhone 15 has a smaller capacity 3,349 mamp hours despite that the iPhone 15 has the longer battery life it earned an active use score of 13 hours and 20 minutes as opposed to 12 hours and 6 minutes from the Galaxy the iPhone was better at all of the tests except for calls when it comes to charging speed both phones were able to charge from 0o to around 60% in half an hour however the Samsung is faster to achieve a full charge taking 75 minutes versus 110 minutes on the iPhone both phones support wireless charging and the Galaxy also offers reverse wireless charging now the cameras the galaxy s24 has a 50 map main cam a 10 map three times telephoto and a 12 map ultrawide camera the iPhone 15 on the other hand has a 48 map main Cam and a 12 map ultrawide there's no dedicated telephoto there the two phones capture great photos during the day they're detailed and sharp noise-free and have a wide dynamic range the processing of detail on the Galaxy looks more natural but the iPhone offers a more natural color rendition while it doesn't have a telephoto cam the iPhone's two times lossless Zoom is solid it's equal to the digital Zoom you'd get from the Samsung but only through the Galaxy s24 can you get a three times optical zoom the ultra wide cameras on both smartphones produce Pleasant daylight photos the nighttime photos from both the s24 and the iPhone 15 are good however the iPhone has more proficient noise reduction and sometimes a wider dynamic range the Galaxy S 24's Ultra wide is better at night though producing cleaner photos with wider dynamic range unlike the iPhone the Galaxy s24 can record videos in 8k resolution as well as 4K 120 FPS slow-mo however apple offers a better implementation of its cinematic mode which creates a blurred background behind your subject anyway 4K videos from the iPhone's main camera have more detail and more natural processing and colors than the Galaxy the iPhone's two times zoomed video is quite nice even if it doesn't match the detail and sharpness of the Galaxy's three time zoom and actually the s24 is ultra wide produces more detail higher SHP sharpness and more natural rendition than the iPhones both of these phones main cameras save good nighttime 4K videos both the Galaxy s24 and the iPhone 15 have a 12 megap front-facing cam with autofocus and they capture equally great selfies and here's a look at 4K selfie videos from either phone so there you have it guys when choosing between the Galaxy s24 and the iPhone 15 there's a lot to consider with the iPhone you get the better ingress protection and a higher res display with Dolby Vision there's secure face ID and the dynamic Island the battery life is better as well as the speakers and there's a better cinematic mode for video however the s24 has a higher refresh rate display which is slightly larger and has a smaller cutout there's an underd display fingerprint reader and AI based software features you get a more powerful chipset and faster charging to 100% plus reverse wireless charging and there's a dedicated telephoto Cam and support for 8K video recording and 4K 120 FPS slow-mo with the Android versus iOS debate aside the Galaxy S 24's advantages outweigh those of the iPhones and it comes out on top in this comparison but the iPhone 15 is not far behind thanks for watching and I'll see you on the next one",
