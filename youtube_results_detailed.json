          "full_text": "we've been using the iPhone 15 lineup for the last couple of weeks since launch and even though this is a great upgrade this year they definitely have some problems and I know you guys are saying that we're Apple Shields we're going to defend Apple to the death but in this video we are going to go through the top 10 problems after 2 weeks now with that said let's get into problem number one which is actually one of my favorite Parts about it which is the new titanium Metal finish and frame on the pro and pro Max when Alpa revealed this new titanium finish they made it seem like it was very very strong however I actually have a scratch on it after only two weeks I don't even know how this happened there's a scratch on the blue finish and it sticks out like an isore and that's probably because apparently titanium is actually a softer metal than stainless steel and of course they have that special PVD coding which I guess is notorious for scratching so you guys have to really be careful and get yourself a good case and even worse with this new titanium finish it's been fingerprint Madness I thought the fingerprints would totally go away but they are still here on the 15 Pro Models and getting into number two one of the big issues that many people have been experiencing over the past couple of weeks has been overheating some people even showed that their phone stopped charging because it was simply too hot and people complained that they're basically just going through Instagram or whatever else even in the background their phone is getting insanely hot now ever since then Apple has finally released an update and a lot of people are saying it's been getting fixed and some people even prior to that said that they turned off background app refresh for Instagram and that magically solved all of the issues of course we do know that the a17 Pro chip is a very hot chip in some cases using 40% more power than the a16 which led to a lot of throttling in gaming but since the update I've done some testing and to my surprise I played a bunch of games at Max brightness and the display didn't even dim the performance was just fine I'm actually shocked at how well it's been working so while overheating was an issue it does seem like it's getting a lot better and if if you're really worried about overheating there's also the Razer phone cooler which I have tested and it seriously gets insanely cold down to 3\u00b0 C to basically stop your iPhone from heat soaking and reducing FPS in games especially those AAA titles that are coming very soon so if you want to check that out use the link down below now on to problem number three we have an issue with the main cameras the 48 megapixel sensor on both the pro and the pro Max and now the entire lineup have that new sensor the issue is that when you get too close to something like when you're trying to scan a check or take a closeup photo it automatically switches to the ultra wide camera which can totally ruin the quality and that's because this new sensor has terrible minimum Focus distance we actually did a comparison between the 15 Pro 14 pro and 13 Pro and the crazy thing was the 13 Pro 1 and all of those closeup comparison tests so that's a big issue that's happening with these new 48 megapixel cameras and I really hope that Apple can fix it in the future now moving on to problem number four of course we know that the pro Max has the new 5x telephoto camera which is absolutely amazing and you got to pay a lot of extra cash to get it $200 more for the pro Max compared to the iPhone 15 Pro of course you do get double the storage which is nice so it's a $100 difference but when you're zooming in between 3x and 4.9x the cheaper 15 Pro actually gives you better photo quality that's because you're skipping from literally the 1X lens all the way up to 5x Optical so everything in between is not as good as on the pro of course they have the 2x which kind of crops into the sensor and it's really good on both of these but between 3x and 4.9 the quality does go down now onto problem number five because of this new rounded Edge design the entire iPhone 15 lineup is now literally more fragile than it was before multiple drop tests have shown that the 15 lineup is fairing worse than previous models basically cracking faster and if you don't believe that it actually makes sense because if you take a look at the front glass because it now curves around and it uses 2.5d glass it's now more exposed and it's easier to basically hit a Little Rock in the just the right place and shatter the entire display on both the front and the back glass as well whereas previously with the iPhone 14 13 and 12s you had the metal that extended all the way to the edge with the flat more sharp corners and that would really protect the display glass but now it is definitely more fragile now moving on to problem number six yes of course we do have the new USBC Port which has been amazing and it can actually charge other devices like let's say your airpods your Apple watch basically anything you want even the Razor phone cooler which gets insanely cold powered from the port itself but there has been an issue that people have experienced some people have tried to charge their iPhone 15 Pro using a battery Bank however the iPhone was actually charging the battery Bank doing it the wrong way so somebody came back their iPhone was dead and their battery bank had a higher charge which is completely not what's supposed to happen so basically the only solution that they found at the moment was to try to charge the iPhone via the usba a port on the battery Bank if it has one to avoid the direction going the wrong way so hopefully Apple can fix this to make sure that doesn't happen to anybody in the future cuz they'll get screwed with a dead iPhone for problem number seven to my surprise the iPhone 15 Pro Max which is supposed to be very strong especially with the titanium frame is the first iPhone in many years that actually failed the benest from Jerry rig everything yes you saw him try to bend it and boom the glass shattered apparently what happened is that Apple removed a certain piece on the inside kind of like a metal frame piece just on the 15 Pro Max and then Jerry rig also tested the 15 plus and it did not Bend so it's only the pro Max that is having this major issue and it's kind of a little bit sad especially with the titanium now for problem number eight we have the regular iPhone 15 models and guess what these are the most expensive phones in the world that still have 60 htz displays this should not be a thing in late 2023 this is ridiculous Apple should have given us at least 90 HZ to somewhat stay competitive now I know the general public doesn't care that much they might not even notice but in terms of the specs and experience in comparisons to other Android phones that are much cheaper this is a big deal what's basically happening is that Apple lives in their own little world pretending that the only phones that exist are their iPhone 15s and 15 Pros so they basically skimp out on some regular 15 features in order to make the Pro Models look good and yes that does work to boost sales of the pros and then of course we have problem number nine which is once again the USBC Port but on the regular 15 models the speeds are insanely slow at 480 megabits per second basically the slowest USBC port in existence on an expensive $800 and $900 iPhone Apple probably did this just to make the pros look a lot better and this is very annoying even though not many people actually use the port for transferring it just sucks that they're making this limitation and then finally for problem number 10 we have the action button on the new iPhone 15 Pro Models and the big issue is that you can only do one thing at a time even if you want to toggle the silent mode you have to basically go back and forth between your customizable actions back to the silent mode or I even found myself having to go into the control center instead to toggle silent mode because the action button can only do one thing and I'd rather have it do something more unique and useful what Apple should have done was enable some new features where you can single tap for something like silent mode double tap for something else and then also tap and hold for another action they should have gave us flexibility like that so we could have multiple things at once multiple actions not just one at one time that would have been so much better in terms of functionality but they left us with just one so there you guys go those are the the top 10 problems after 2 weeks with the entire iPhone 15 lineup let me know which one you've personally experienced and what annoys you down in the comment section below and if you enjoy this video subscribe above and check out one of those two over there thanks for watching and we'll see you in the next [Music] video",

          "full_text": "I've been using the iPhone 15 for over 8 months now and I've seen a lot of people online talking about how this phone is exactly the same as the iPhone 14 13 and even the iPhone 12 but I would argue that this is the best nonpr iPhone that ever came out and it actually tops a lot of the pro iPhones as well here's why so first of all even though the design looks similar to previous models they actually curve the edges just enough to make it way way more comfortable in the hand and if you pair that with his matte finish on the back it just look looks and feels way more comfortable and premium one more thing that this phone got from the previous 14 pro lineup is of course the dynamic Island and I didn't really care about this feature when it came out I actually thought it's just a differently shaped Notch but notice how I did call it a feature and that's CU it is you get a lot of useful glanceable notifications on it as well as various different controls for different apps all mushed into this Dynamic Island and even though I never really had an issue with the notch uh now after using the 14 pro and the 15 I don't actually think I will be able to go back to an iPhone with a notch because this looks much better it's way more useful and it's simply not wasted space and of course I think we can also call this part of the iPhone 15 design get USBC and again I didn't really think that would be something I prefer over the lightning connector but using uh a USBC iPhone for an extended period of time I actually do do see the benefit of having just one charger to rule them all it's just one less thing to think about now on the iPhone 15 uh it is kept at USB 2.0 speed so for data transfer it's not going to be any faster than lightning was but if you get an iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max you do get faster speeds with that one so if you are using USB to transfer huge amounts of data from into your phone then just note that this is not a fast Port but since I am usually using airdrop for most things I don't really care that much and of course the speed of that Port doesn't affect charging speeds in any way cuz charging doesn't require a fast Port but these are still not great we are talking about iPhones though and all of them charge kind of slow and that's the case with the iPhone 15 it charges a bit over 20 watts wired I'm usually using a wireless charger so doesn't really matter while we're at it if you do need a cool 3 in1 wireless charger definitely check out macback this is the one that I'm using right behind me here this video is not sponsored but I will leave an affiliate Link in the description for their 3 in-one charger which I absolutely love along with the macback case that actually has a lot of additional magnets in it uh aside from the standard Mac safe ring and it fits perfectly with the charger as you can see like I said this video is not sponsored by macback but I do love their products and you can get a discount if you use my link in the description below so charging in and of itself is fine I guess but uh the more important thing is battery life and I actually think that it's pretty good I really don't want to get into screen on time cuz that can vary a lot depending on how you use your phone dayto day but it's solid and it can get me through the day with absolutely no problems since I started using this phone I only had like three or four days where I had to top it up a little bit in the evening but I'm usually ending the day at around 30% but if you really want to talk numbers I would say I get around 9 hours of screen on time on average which is absolutely Fair like if you get an 24 Ultra or an iPhone 15 Pro Max or even a 15 plus you would definitely get more battery out of those models but since this is sort of a compact phone I guess for 2024 standards at least I think 9 hours is more than good enough and it's most likely going to get you through the day with absolutely no issues and that is in part because well it only has a 60 HZ display I'm liking these Segways today I'm doing good it's a 6.1 in super RNA xdr OLED display and it's absolutely amazing in every way like top-of-the-line industry standard stuff but it's not promotion so it's kept at 60 HZ and at first I really had a problem with it but now I just don't care and I don't even notice it anymore cuz I've been using this phone for such a long time that it's just became a normal thing you got to remember that up until a few years ago or like five or six years ago most phones were 60 HZ but on the other hand it's not the strongest argument out there the industry is advancing the cameras are advancing everything in these phones is getting better and better each year and most if not all mid-range Android phones actually get a 120 HZ refresh rate so when it came out and today as well it was one of the only 60 HZ phones in its price range actually I think it was the only one but I really don't feel like it's a big deal honestly and I don't feel like it's something that should be talked about that much I don't mind it I use this phone every day and it's absolutely fine iOS is super smooth anyway and it doesn't ruin the experience for me if it does for you that's also fair and if you want an iPhone you have to get a pro one but putting the refresh rate aside like I said this display is absolutely amazing it has great colors great contrast 1,000 standard Nets of brightness and peing at 2,000 knits outdoor in the sunlight so it's a really bright display I can't really find a single additional flaw to it aside from the refresh rate so if you are looking to get this phone just is promotion something that personally care about or not that's all it comes down to but we've been talking about the display for way too long How fast is this phone you ask it's super fast actually it has the a16 bionic chip and it's not the newest one it's actually the same chip that was in the 14 pro but the 14 pro is also still super fast and there's really not much to say about it anything you want to do you can do on the iPhone 15 and I definitely feel like it's going to stay fast and responsive for a really long time since Apple's chips are generally really good it of course came with iOS 7 and of course it's going to get ios 18 that just got announced a few days ago which is a story for a different video but seems like it's going to be really really good a lot of AI stuff a lot of customization stuff they actually like took from Android and it's going to be supported for a really long time since Apple generally offers a lot of years of software support it has 6 GB of RAM 128 256 or 512 GB of storage I actually have the base 128 model and I'm super cool with it but I'm using a lot of cloud storage so if you are storing stuff on your device maybe go with the 256 version Al it's not necessary it comes in five colors that's black blue green yellow and pink so it has a lot of options all you have to do is pick speaking of picks it has two cameras on the back it actually has a updated 48 megapixel main wide lens and a 12 map Ultra wide so we still didn't get the telephoto on the regular model but since the main sensor is 48 megapixels you can actually use a 2X digital Zoom that doesn't lose out on quality cuz they're just cropping in on that 48 megapix sensor and giving you a 12 megapixel result so you kind of have two and a half cameras on the back I guess the main lens is absolutely great I've been actually using this phone to shoot a lot of my videos recently not this one though cuz it's in my hand now but you know in general colors are nice and accurate it's more than sharp enough and you get most iPhone camera features with it like night mode action mode cinematic mode you get photographic Styles which don't actually use them use the standard one please but you get them if you want them one thing that it doesn't support that the 15 Pro does support of course are those Pro formats so that's Pro raw and PR res and lock for video are these formats something you'll actually need dayto day I don't really think so if you are like a digital Creator or a photographer videographer that kind of knows a bit more about this stuff uh then it might be something that you're interested in you still won't be able to use these cameras like in a professional setting of course but for a lot of stuff it will be a good addition but uh just keep in mind that if you are using these formats they flatten the colors and everything out so you would have to uh fix all these things in post you would have to edit the photos and the videos to get the uh desired result with it so if you are just someone that wants to use their camera like a normal person then yeah you shouldn't use this formats anyway and as just a simple point and shoot camera without too much tinkering this is one of the best options out there and I know you all had sleepless nights thinking about what are the best iPhone 15 camera settings that I can possibly use to get the best result with photos and videos well I actually made a video about it and you can check it out here",

          "full_text": "(upbeat music) - All right, so this is Apple's brand new, latest and greatest iPhone 15. And nothing inside is new or anything that we haven't seen before in some other phone somewhere. Now that doesn't mean\nit's not a good phone. You can actually be a really\ngood phone and not really new, they aren't mutually exclusive. And it turns out, that is actually Apple's\nstrategy with this phone. The more I use this phone, the more I see Apple's textbook, late mover advantage strategy\ncoming into play here. They're gonna take something we've literally already seen before and then do it the Apple way. So on the outside, let's see, how would I describe\nthis new phone's design? Kind of familiar, I don't know, somewhat reminiscent of the 14. How does Apple say it? - iPhone 15 has an all new\ndesign that's simply gorgeous. - All new? All new? Really? Okay, I mean, I don't know about all new but this phone definitely\ninherits the same looks and general design as last year again. But you know what's at least partially new is actually the way it feels in the hand. So I said this in the 15 Pro review, but they've done a good job\nsoftening the corners here. So it still looks boxy,\nstill has aluminum rails, but it's more comfortable to hold, since these corners aren't as sharp, they're a little bit rounded off. And then, this is also\nthe first glass-backed, non-Pro iPhone with a satin back, and I am loving the satin back, this is like a nice, soft\ntouch, frosted glass back here. I know there's a super\ncomplicated process too to like get this single\npiece of glass on the back to be two different colors and two different\nthicknesses and all that, and I can totally respect it. But honestly, the colors,\nthey are super weak. People were saying in the last video the the color grading must be off, it looks like it's white instead of blue. No, this blue phone really\ndoesn't look that blue at all in almost any lighting, it's like 1% blue. But either way, you can say between the aluminum and the pale light colors, these are also probably the most fingerprint\nresistant iPhones in years. On the sides, same button placements, same speakers placements,\nsame mute switch, no action button on this phone. Honestly, you could probably use an iPhone 14 case on the iPhone 15. But around the front, new screen, well, not new, again, but new\nto this iPhone, new screen. You now get the dynamic island on the non-Pro iPhones this year, which is very much doing the whole punch cutout the Apple way. So the notch is finally dead until maybe a new iPhone SE\nbrings it back, it could happen. But also, slowly, app developers\nhave been getting on board in useful ways over the past year. I already have a few favorites now, my airline app's giving\nme real-time flight info, my weather apps, Uber, et cetera. But while we're up here talking about the screen on\nthis phone, it's also brighter, It's up to 2,000 knits now,\nwhich looks awesome outdoors. But also, it's 2023, and this is an $800 phone that\nstill has a 60 hertz display. This is actually really fascinating to me. It's so odd. Like, on one hand, for most people buying this\nphone, it's totally fine. It literally doesn't have,\nit's a new baseline iPhone, have you talked to someone who\nbuys a new baseline iPhone? They literally don't care. It doesn't matter, it's not something they pay attention to, you could ask them right now how many frames per second their phone is and they wouldn't have an\nanswer, just doesn't matter. So just as long as it works and it's all relatively\nsmooth like last year and the year before and the year before, it's totally a non-factor. I have actually literally\nhanded 120 hertz phone to people next to a 60 hertz phone, and even side by side next to each other, they can't see the difference. Or if they do, it's just like, oh, that's a subtle thing\nthat seems kind of neat but they'd be totally\nfine missing out on it. So with the target\ndemographic of this phone, it's totally fine. But on the other hand, Apple, the richest technology\ncompany in the world, does stuff all the time that regular people will\nliterally never notice, that are subtle improvements\nor changes here and there, all the time. Like, when they switched\nthese baseline iPhones from LCD to OLED displays, do you think any of these\npeople actually noticed that? Or what about going from\nthe A15 Bionic last year to this A16 Bionic? Do you think people are actually noticing the differences here? Or what about when they\njust added 5G to the iPhone and most people didn't care? Like, making subtle improvements over time is what modern smartphones\nare all about these days. And I would actually argue that a higher refresh rate is more noticeable to more people than some\nof those other things. Like, I think you could today\nhand me, a professional, an unlabeled iPhone with an\nA15 Bionic and an A16 Bionic, and it would take me quite some time to find the real differences between them. And so, that combined with the fact that it's incredibly cheap\nand easy and reasonable to get to like at least a 90 hertz phone, isn't the new Moto G is\nlike 90 hertz at $170 or something like that? Now I'm sure that's a\nhorrible looking screen compared to this iPhone, it's 720P with the brightness\nof a box of crayons. But still they decided\nto add that to that phone because Motorola knew that\nenough people would notice it and feel that smoothness difference and it's a higher level\nof perceived performance. So it's just wild to me, knowing how easy it would\nbe for Apple to make this even a 90 hertz display, but\nthey just refuse to do it because they've attached the\nword Pro to that feature. It's promotion for the Pro phones. And it just strikes me as a tool just to sort of continue widening the gap as much as they can\nbetween the Pro iPhones and the non-Pro iPhones,\nand they're happy to do it, even if it makes this iPhone 15 the most expensive phone in the world with a 60 hertz display. Anyway, speaking of widening that gap, the Pro phones this year also\ngot a brand new A17 Pro chip but this iPhone 15 gets\nlast year's A16 Bionic from the 14 Pro. Honestly, the renaming of the Pro chip might be the most interesting part because it implies that it's definitely not going to trickle down to the baseline phone next year. But either way, this A16 bionic here is more than good enough\nin a phone of this price, as far as performance and\nhandling everyday tasks and gaming and flying\naround iOS at 60 hertz. And the one thing you definitely\ncan argue for 60 hertz would be battery life, because despite all the\nissues floating around, the battery life on these\nphones has been pretty good. So I don't know if you saw it, but Apple has officially now addressed the heat and battery\nissues that some people, including myself, have been\nreporting with these iPhones. So an iOS update is coming and it seems like some\nspecific third party apps, like Instagram, were also having issues and those should be getting updates too. But on average, the battery life on my 15 has been better than my\nbattery on the 15 Pro. And the 15 Plus looks to have the best battery life ever on any iPhone, which is really promising. So that combination of the\nA16 Bionic, which is not new, and 60 hertz screens, which are not new, are giving you great battery life. Also, USB-C is definitely not new but here it is alongside all\nthe benefits that come with it, from using the same cable\nto charge everything, to plugging into more accessories, like monitors and keyboards\nand all kinds of other stuff. It is sad that the older chip does mean there's no USB 3 controller so there are no USB 3 data\nspeeds, it's still slow, but honestly, unless you're using the Pro iPhone's camera features, there's almost nobody\nhere buying this phone that's gonna actually need\nfast data transfer anyway so I guess you can give it a pass. And they managed to do\nit in the Apple way too. They color matched the\ninside of the USB-C port with the color of the\nphone, and they actually, I don't know if you've seen this, they print the model\nnumber inside the port. So Apple really loves hiding this in the most discreet way possible. You know, I should really\ngives some appreciation to some of the clever software\nfeatures on the iPhone 15 because you could actually\nconsider them new. So they added stuff like\nan ultra-wideband chip so you can find your phone\nmore easily with an Apple Watch or be found on Find My\nFriends, that's new. They also added these clever audio effects and video effects at an OS level, so they work inside of any app. So you can be on a phone\ncall or a video call or a Google Meet or Zoom or whatever, and flip on the background\nnoise cancellation and it works really shockingly well, it's very, very good. So I'm on a phone call with myself, this is what it'll sound\nlike to be in a room with the dishwasher\nrunning, the HVAC going, and the sink going right next to me, right next to the microphone. When I switch the mic from Standard mode to Voice Isolation mode, even though all the same\nnoises are still happening, it does a much better\njob of just picking out specifically my voice, really smart and it's genuinely new. There's also some other not so new stuff, like they just now added\ndownloadable offline areas to Apple Maps and interactable widgets, and they finally added an\n80% battery charge limiter in the settings. So you can check out all this stuff, I did a full video on the iOS 17 update at the link below that like button, if you wanna watch that, you\nshould definitely check it out after you watch this video. What I will say is one of\nthe most liked features I talked about in that\nvideo is Standby mode. And on the Pro iPhone, when\nyou put it on a charger, turn it sideways, it keeps the screen on which it can do because\nit goes to one Hertz, it's an LTPO display, and it's\nfine staying on like that. But on the non-Pro iPhone,\nwhich does not have LTPO, it's basically locked at I\nthink either 30 or 60 hertz, either way it doesn't drop to one Hertz. So Apple just decides, we'll turn off the screen\nafter a little bit, which kind of feels like it defeats the purpose of this feature, so then you have to nudge the\ntable or or bump the stand to wake it up like an Apple Watch charger. Just a notable difference between the Pro and non-Pro iPhones. But last but not least, these new cameras are actually\nweird, but in a good way. So iPhone 15 has been upgraded to a new set of 12 megapixel ultra wide and the new 48 megapixel main camera. It's not the same sensor as the Pro, it's actually slightly smaller, but it has a larger max aperture\nof F1.6 to make up for it. And then, it's also\ndoing a combo of binning and detailed transfer to give you this new 24 megapixel photo\nas a result by default. Now, if you were paying attention before, you'll remember that this new iPhone has the exact same chip\nas last year's Pro iPhone. Same processing cores, same\nimage signal processor, same neural engine, same\nA16 Bionic, same everything. So why is this new 24 megapixel default only coming to the newest iPhone\n15 and not last year's Pro? Like, I still have last year's Pro phone and I've updated it to the latest software and it does not get this feature, it's still shooting 12 megapixels. So honestly now my base iPhone\n15's non-zoomed in photos are actually looking a little better, a little more detailed than\nlast year's Pro phones. And then, there's the new auto-Portrait Mode detection\nfeature, which is pretty sweet. Basically you don't have\nto switch to Portrait Mode to take a photo that captures\nall of the depth information that allows you to turn it into\na Portrait Mode photo later. So as long as you're pointing\nthe camera at a human subject or a cat or a dog as identified\nby the neural engine, or if you tap to focus, you\nautomatically get this little F at the bottom corner of the screen, which means it's capturing the data needed for Portrait Mode, just in case. And so, then, later, if you decide, eh, I actually do want this\nto be a Portrait Mode shot, you go into your gallery and just make it a Portrait Mode photo, that you can even then go\nin and edit and play with. Some people have been describing it as being able to change\nthe focus point later. It's not exactly doing that, you can't like save something that was out of focus by bringing it back. But basically, for the classic iPhone shot where it kind of looks like\neverything is in focus, then, yeah, you can\nplay with Portrait Mode and get really good results. Last year's Pro iPhone has the same chip, also has a 48 megapixel main camera and has the same neural engine, doesn't get this feature, for some reason. Also kind of weird. So look, with these reviews, we always make a lot of judgements about what we think the\ntypical iPhone buyer is, what they actually care\nabout, what they'll notice, what they will appreciate\nabout a new phone. And with this one, I do\nfeel like they've stacked up enough of these subtle improvements, that even though it looks the same and there's not really that\nmuch that's actually new here, they've at least stacked enough things that it feels like an\nappreciably better phone. So my verdict is, if\nyou have an iPhone 14, you don't have to upgrade,\nof course, even a 13 maybe. But if you have an older phone and you're looking to\nupgrade to a new iPhone, every year, I always\nget friends asking like, \"Oh, should I just get the older, like last year's iPhone\nto save some money?\" And no, I actually wouldn't, I would say just get the iPhone 15. There's enough new changes here, it's a better phone in\nevery way and it's also USB. Like, you don't buy a base iPhone to get the bleeding edge of tech, you buy it just 'cause\nit works and it's fine and it's gonna be familiar and\nwork for the next few years. And just knowing that you're gonna have it for the next few years, I would not recommend\nbuying a Lightning iPhone as we just moved everything forward into the world of USB type C. Just get the new one, just\ngrab the boring new iPhone with nothing that's actually that new. It's just gonna work. That's it, thanks for watching,\ncatch you in the next one. Peace. (upbeat music)",

          "full_text": "[Music] today we have this year's new vanilla iPhone the iPhone 15 it isn't a pro model so you wouldn't expect The Cutting Edge features here but the iPhone 15 actually does bring quite a few updates compared to last year I'm will for GSM Marina and let's see what this phone is all about in our full review [Music] as ever the new iPhone 15 brings the same overall iPhone formula with some incremental refinements but the changes are noticeable and they bring the regular iPhone 15 in line with last year's Pro Models for example rather than a notch cutout now you get the pill-shaped dynamic Island which last year was exclusive to the pros and compared to the iPhone 14 you get a new brighter display a new 48 megapixel main camera and a chipset upgrade in terms of the design the iPhone 15 is basically identical to the previous iPhone Generations again the back is flat and made of glass the glass is etched to provide a matte finish the rounded corners and flat aluminum frame are familiar though now the frame has a contoured edge where it meets the glass just as before the iPhone 15 comes with ip68 rated ingress protection and it can survive in up to 6 M of fresh water for up to 30 minutes but this year Apple has finally made the move from lightning to USB type-c the standard used on basically all other smartphones however the iPhone 15 and 15 plus get USB 2.0 rather than the speedier USB 3 on the Pro Models and something else worth mentioning is that on this model you still get your typical alert slider while on this year's Pro Models that has been replaced with an action key the OLED display of the iPhone 15 is 6.1 in with a sharp pixel density of 46 1 PPI and like last year there's only a 60 HZ refresh rate one of these Generations Apple should give us a high refresh rate on a ven iPhone but not this time this means your swiping and scrolling will again appear less smooth to the eye than on most other phones which feature 90 HZ or above I mentioned earlier the screen's brightness and when maxing out the manual slider we achieved around 800 nits about the same as on the iPhone 14 but unlike last year's model the iPhone 15's Auto brightness mode has the ability to provide a boost when in bright conditions like direct sunlight with this boost kicking in we measured nearly 1650 nits maximum a huge Improvement besides the extra brightness the display behaves much the same as last year it's extremely color accurate and there's support for True tone which keeps colors looking consistent in various lighting conditions there's also support for hdr10 and Dolby Vision probably the most notable change is the pill-shaped cutout rather than a notch this this cutout houses the selfie Cam and the 3D Toff camera which is used for Apple's face ID is fast and responsive as ever you also get the full Dynamic Island functionality where the UI extends the black bar to show relevant info as well as display shortcuts to call up certain apps from the background for audio the iPhone 15 has a stereo speaker setup with Dolby Atmos support the speakers are a little quieter this time around with a loudness score of good versus last year is very good but the audio quality is excellent all around from base to mids and highs you can hear for yourself through the provided link you can get the iPhone 15 with 128 256 or 512 gigs of storage and though that isn't expandable through MicroSD you can attach USB storage the new iPhones run Apple's latest IOS 17 out of the box and is pretty much the same experience as the previous version with a few new features sprinkled in you don't get a typical always on display with the iPhone 15 like you would on the Pro Models but there is support for the new standby mode which is an always on display which turns on while the phone is charging in landscape orientation on top of the extensive widget support we had before now there are interactive widgets which you can manipulate on the home screen itself there is also more customization available for your contacts with a feature called Contact posters you have plenty of options including photos memojis and text some other new features in iOS 17 include voice isolation during calls off line maps live voicemail and sharing passwords With Friends the iPhone 15 brings an upgraded Ultra wideband two chip for more precise location finding for the find my friends feature and like the other new iPhones it supports video output via type-c alt mode it's basically display mirroring on all of the iPhone 15 models you get letter boxing on a standard 16x9 external display except with certain apps such as Netflix which support full screen output the iPhone 15 also supports USB host mode through which you can connect peripherals like a mouse or keyboard or an external hard drive I mentioned that the iPhone 15's upgrades bring it in line with last year's pro model and that's most apparent with the Apple a16 bionic chipset it's the same as in the iPhone 14 pro and a nice upgrade over the a15 bionic and the regular iPhone 14 both when it comes to raw power and power efficiency in CPU benchmarks the iPhone 15 comes in near the top of the charts only out Ted by the iPhone 15 Pro Models with their newer silicon it also holds its own in graphics tests against some of the top Android devices running a Snapdragon hn2 so even though you don't get The Cutting Edge Apple silicon here the Peak Performance is still among the best the thermal management does leave more to be desired though at least when it comes to GPU performance in our prolonged graphic stress test the iPhone 15's GPU throttled down to around 50% of its initial performance CPU intensive tasks Fair much better and the throttling there was negligible but outside of the benchmarks we didn't notice any stutters or drops in performance while gaming and the phone never got uncomfortably hot the iPhone 15 has a 3,349 mamp battery and in our tests scored a solid endurance rating of 98 hours better than last year's iPhone 14 pro despite having the same chipset similar to previous iPhone models the iPhone 15 officially supports 20 Wat power delivery charging but there's no charger in the box with a proper adapter we were able to charge the phone from 0 to 58% in 30 minutes and a full charge took an hour and 50 minutes not terribly fast there's also support for wireless charging and mag safe support for those magnetized wireless chargers the iPhone 15 has two cameras on the back a new 48 megap Main Cam and a 12 map Ultra wide cam it's not the same as the new 48 map cam on the pro Pro Models but in a similar fashion it outputs 24 mapel photos by default looking at the daylight photos it's apparent that there's plenty of detail here more than we got from last year's 12 megapixel camera the sharpness is great and there's nice contrast and good dynamic range too and as you'd expect from an iPhone the consistency from shot to shot is excellent also typical of Apple the color science is very accurate but looks quite muted compared to The Punchy rendition popular with most other manufacturers you can also Al take photos in 12 megapixels which does save a little bit of space but there's noticeably less fine detail if you go this route especially in foliage there's a two-time zoom toggle and these photos are nice they come out in 12 megap resolution and certain things like folage can look a bit fuzzy but otherwise the overall rendition is nearly identical to the regular onetime shots portrait photos from the main cam look great with sharp looking subjects excellent skin tones and really nice separation even though there's no light R scanner like you get on the pro model with the new automatic portraits feature the camera can detect a scene suitable for a portrait and give you a popup to quickly toggle a portrait effect on the Fly and on top of that even when you don't actively press the F toggle the iPhone will still capture a depth map so you can go into the photos app and turn the photo into a portrait later it even works for selfies too in low light photos from the main cam are excellent with great detail and sharpness and a natural color rendition the dynamic rang is pretty wide despite the darker Shadows highlights are handled really well there is automatic night mode processing but the trouble is that it's hard to predict when it will kick in the automatic detection is quite conservative and in many scenes it may not trigger when it does though you get brighter and less noisy shadows and some extra sharpening the net Mode photos also come out in 12 megapixels rather than 24 the iPhone 15 can capture video in up to 4K resolution on all of its cameras the video quality from the main camera is gr with a rich detail and wide dynamic range the picture is clean with no noise and while the colors aren't exactly Punchy they look good the main cam has sensor shift ois but electronic stabilization is also available across all the cameras it works great to smooth out bumps and shakes in low light the main cam can capture some excellent videos they're crisp with natural looking colors plenty of detail and low noise now let's talk about the ultra wide cam it's perform is actually a bit disappointing the 12 megapixel photos come out looking a bit soft and lacking in fine detail with some visible noise and since this camera lacks autofocus you can't use it to show close-up subjects like you can with the ultrawide on the Pro Models at least the iPhone 15 does a good job in matching the contrast colors and dynamic range to those of the main camera at night the ultra wide cam struggles it shots are quite noisy while Shadows are handled decently you can end up with blown highlights the color rendition is notably warmer as well just like with the main cam the automatic night mode doesn't activate very reliably when it does kick in the noise is cleaned up somewhat and the exposure is brighter but there is excessive Sharpening at it as well when it comes to video capture the ultra wide does a decent job his 4K videos are clean with colors that match the main cams pretty well finally there's the 12 megapix selfie cam which has autofocus it captures sharp photos with Pleasant skin tones great contrast and dynamic range and plenty of detail some details in the face do come out too pronounced though which could be unflattering so there you have it the iPhone 15 Apple didn't reinvent the wheel here but there are some nice upgrades over the vanilla iPhone 14 you get the brighter display faster chipset and nicer 48 map main Cam and there's the dynamic Island too which lends a slightly more modern look these may not be enough reasons to upgrade from the iPhone 14 but if you're coming from an older iPhone the 15 looks like the nicer phone of the two for just 100 bucks more and if you can spare an extra 10% on top of that the outgoing iPhone 14 pro where it's still available will get you a stainless steel frame a high refresh rate display and three times optical zoom but still the cheaper iPhone 15 is lighter with longer battery life and longer software support and it comes with the super Universal USBC connectivity so we think the vanilla iPhone 15 is well worth considering if you're planning to get an iPhone thanks for watching guys if you're looking for alternatives to the iPhone 15 you can check out our reviews of the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 pro see you next time",
